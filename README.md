# Alexa_Skills_Kit_EnglishToGermanTranslator

This Alexa application uses google translate API to translate English to German. It requires you to have an API key, which you can get from https://console.developers.google.com/ .

It proves difficult to have Alexa response in a different language. So the application doesn't really speak the english, but it does send the correction to you directly to the Alexa application that you have installed on your phone.

But obviously, the translation is not perfect. Thank you.
