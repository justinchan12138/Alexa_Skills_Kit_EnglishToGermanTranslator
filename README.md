# Alexa_Skills_Kit_EnglishToGermanTranslator

This Alexa application uses google translate API to translate English to German. It requires you to have an API key, whihc you can get from https://console.developers.google.com/ .

It proves difficult to have Alexa responses in a different language. So the application doesn't really speak the english, but it does send the correction to you directly to the Alexa application that you have installed on your phone.
